As I complete this stage of the GOMYCODE Bootcamp, I feel both confident and excited about taking the next step in my career path as a software developer. This journey has been intense and rewarding, and I believe I’ve gained a strong foundation to build upon as I move into more advanced roles and real-world projects.

#### **Readiness for the Next Career Step**

I feel ready to start applying what I’ve learned in a professional environment. Through this program, I’ve gained not only technical skills but also the discipline and mindset required for continuous learning, teamwork, and problem-solving — all of which are essential in the tech industry. I’m looking forward to working in a team setting where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow.

#### **Skills Gained During the Bootcamp**

Throughout the Bootcamp, I’ve gained a wide range of valuable skills, including:

* **Front-end development** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js
* **Back-end development** with Node.js and Express
* **Working with databases** like MongoDB, and understanding CRUD operations
* **Version control** using Git and GitHub
* **API development and testing**, including RESTful design and tools like HTTPie
* **Problem-solving and debugging** in real-world project contexts
* **Project structure and planning**, including how to break down large tasks into manageable components

Beyond technical skills, I’ve also developed soft skills such as communication, collaboration, time management, and how to learn quickly under pressure.

### Final Thought:

The Bootcamp has made me believe more in my capabilities. I now see software development not as a mystery but as a process I can engage in, improve at, and eventually master. I’m excited to take on internships or junior developer roles where I can continue learning while delivering value.
